		 I am currently a Master 1 student at the IESEG School of Management in Paris, with digital marketing as a speciality. At this point in my academic career I am looking for a 6-month digital marketing internship beginning in January 2021. Having worked for the previous 3 summers, I have learned a great deal about endurance, independence, and initiative.
